In this exercise you'll build a simple Android application, which presents data about various countries around the world. As a backend for the application, you'll use openly available countries REST API - https://restcountries.eu.

You can take the application UI and functionality as far as your imagination (and time) takes you, but please make sure you achieve at least the following:
The application should consist of at least two views:
1) List of all countries with basic details on each such as: Name (English and local), national flag, population
2) Details of a single country, with an extended geographical and social introduction

Make sure the application is adapted to properly run on various screen sizes and devices
Add unit tests for any complex logic you put into the application
You'll get extra points on a clean and elegant SW design as well for the use of advanced programming methods and frameworks
